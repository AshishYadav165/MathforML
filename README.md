# MathforML
Mathematics for Machine Learning
Computational Linear Algebra Series

# Overview

This repository provides a structured, implementation-focused treatment of linear algebra for machine learning. 
The emphasis is on understanding how linear algebra operates inside real computational systems. 
Rather than presenting formulas in isolation, each concept is connected to code, numerical examples, and practical machine learning applications.

## The objective is not memorization. The objective is computational clarity. ##

# Scope of the Series

This project develops the core linear algebra foundations required for machine learning, including:
Vector representation and geometry
Dot products and projections
Matrix operations and matrix multiplication
Linear transformations
Systems of linear equations
Matrix inverse and numerical stability
Orthogonality and QR decomposition
Least squares and general linear models
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Applications such as PCA, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction

Topics are organized for machine learning relevance rather than traditional textbook order.

# Learning Structure

Each major concept is developed using a consistent framework:
Clear definition
Intuition and geometric interpretation
Small numerical example
Python implementation
Computational verification
Common mistakes
Practice problems with solutions

All notebooks are fully executable and designed for hands-on experimentation.
